# Chapter 07: The Secret to Self-Control

IN 1971 , as the Vietnam War was heading into its sixteenth year, congressmen
Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy from Illinois made a
discovery that stunned the American public. While visiting the troops, they had
learned that over 15 percent of U.S. soldiers stationed there were heroin addicts.
Follow-up research revealed that 35 percent of service members in Vietnam had
tried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted—the problem was even
worse than they had initially thought.
The discovery led to a flurry of activity in Washington, including the creation
of the Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention under President Nixon to
promote prevention and rehabilitation and to track addicted service members
when they returned home.
Lee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding that completely
upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found that when soldiers
who had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them became
readdicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years. In other
words, approximately nine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam
eliminated their addiction nearly overnight.
This finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which considered
heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible condition. Instead, Robins
revealed that addictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical
change in the environment. In Vietnam, soldiers spent all day surrounded by
cues triggering heroin use: it was easy to access, they were engulfed by the
constant stress of war, they built friendships with fellow soldiers who were also
heroin users, and they were thousands of miles from home. Once a soldier
returned to the United States, though, he found himself in an environment devoid
of those triggers. When the context changed, so did the habit.
Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someone becomes

addicted at home or with friends, goes to a clinic to get clean—which is devoid
of all the environmental stimuli that prompt their habit—then returns to their old
neighborhood with all of their previous cues that caused them to get addicted in
the first place. It’s no wonder that usually you see numbers that are the exact
opposite of those in the Vietnam study. Typically, 90 percent of heroin users
become readdicted once they return home from rehab.
The Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs about bad
habits because it challenged the conventional association of unhealthy behavior
as a moral weakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker, or an addict, you’ve been
told your entire life that it is because you lack self-control—maybe even that
you’re a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our
problems is deeply embedded in our culture.
Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists
analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those
individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead,
“disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way thatdoes no t
requireheroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in
tempting situations.
The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it
the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very
often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the
way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined
person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.
This counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you understand what
happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit that has been encoded in
the mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises. When Patty
Olwell, a therapist from Austin, Texas, started smoking, she would often light up
while riding horses with a friend. Eventually, she quit smoking and avoided it
for years. She had also stopped riding. Decades later, she hopped on a horse
again and found herself craving a cigarette for the first time in forever. The cues
were still internalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a long time.
Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the
environmental cues reappear. This is one reason behavior change techniques can
backfire. Shaming obese people with weight-loss presentations can make them
feel stressed, and as a result many people return to their favorite coping strategy:
overeating. Showing pictures of blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher
levels of anxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette. If you’re not
careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop.
Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings

they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food,
you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more
television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying
about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease
your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more
anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.
Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external
trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once younotice
something, you begin towantit. This process is happening all the time—often
without us realizing it. Scientists have found that showing addicts a picture o f
cocaine for just thirty-three milliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the
brain and sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to consciously
register—the addicts couldn’t even tell you what they had seen—but they craved
the drug all the same.
Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.
Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are
nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.
And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is
hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too
much energy. In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the
long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it
bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a
negative environment.
A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the
most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that
causes it.
If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another
room for a few hours.
If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following
social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.
If you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out
of the bedroom.
If you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading
reviews of the latest tech gear.
If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it
in a closet after each use.

This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. Rather than
make it obvious, you canmake it invisible. I’m often surprised by how effective
simple changes like these can be. Remove a single cue and the entire habit often
fades away.
Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to
resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to
override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower
whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent
optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues o f
your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.
