# Chapter 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad

Habits Impossible
IN THE SUMMER OF 1830, Victor Hugo was facing an impossible deadline. Twelve months
earlier, the French author had promised his publisher a new book. But instead o f
writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects, entertaining guests, and
delaying his work. Frustrated, Hugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline
less than six months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831.
Hugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He collected all o f
his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left
with nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any suitable clothing to go
outdoors, he remained in his study and wrote furiously during the fall and winter
of 1830.The Hunchback of Notre Damewas published two weeks early on
January 14, 1831. *
Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about
making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change:
make it difficult. If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on
your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make your bad
habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call acommitment device.
A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your
actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good
habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away
so he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment device. *
There are many ways to create a commitment device. You can reduce
overeating by purchasing food in individual packages rather than in bulk size.
You can voluntarily ask to be added to the banned list at casinos and online
poker sites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of athletes who
have to “make weight” for a competition choosing to leave their wallets at home
during the week before weigh-in so they won’t be tempted to buy fast food.

As another example, my friend and fellow habits expert Nir Eyal purchased an
outlet timer, which is an adapter that he plugged in between his internet router
and the power outlet. At 10 p.m. each night, the outlet timer cuts off the power to
the router. When the internet goes off, everyone knows it is time to go to bed.
Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage o f
good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation. Whenever I’m looking
to cut calories, for example, I will ask the waiter to split my meal and box half o f
it to gobeforethe meal is served. If I waited until the meal came out and told
myself “I’ll just eat half,” it would never work.
The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to getoutof the
good habit than to get started on it. If you’re feeling motivated to get in shape,
schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the
business you want to start, email an entrepreneur you respect and set up a
consulting call. When the time comes to act, the only way to bail is to cancel the
meeting, which requires effort and may cost money.
Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the
future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However, we can do even
better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.
HOW TO AUTOMATE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT
## Again
John Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his childhood
doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his father’s sawmill. After
attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson returned to Ohio and opened a small
supply store for coal miners.
It seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competition and
enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make money. That
was when Patterson discovered his employees were stealing from him.
In the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receipts were kept
in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded. There were no video
cameras to review behavior and no software to track transactions. Unless you
were willing to hover over your employees every minute of the day, or to
manage all transactions yourself, it was difficult to prevent theft.
As Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an advertisement
for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier. Designed by fellow
Dayton resident James Ritty, it was the first cash register. The machine
automatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each transaction.

Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each.
Employee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next six months,
Patterson’s business went from losing money to making $5,000 in profit—the
equivalent of more than $100,000 today.
Patterson was so impressed with the machine that he changed businesses. He
bought the rights to Ritty’s invention and opened the National Cash Register
Company. Ten years later, National Cash Register had over one thousand
employees and was on its way to becoming one of the most successful
businesses of its time.
The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the
friction until you don’t even have the option to act. The brilliance of the cash
register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically
impossible. Rather than trying to change the employees, it made the preferred
behavior automatic.
Some actions—like installing a cash register—pay off again and again. These
onetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value
over time. I’m fascinated by the idea that a single choice can deliver returns
again and again, and I surveyed my readers on their favorite onetime actions that
lead to better long-term habits. The table on the following page shares some o f
the most popular answers.
I’d wager that if the average person were to simply do half of the onetime
actions on this list—even if they didn’t give another thought to their habits —
most would find themselves living a better life a year from now. These onetime
actions are a straightforward way to employ the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.
They make it easier to sleep well, eat healthy, be productive, save money, and
generally live better.
## Onetime Actions That Lock In Good Habits
Nutrition
Buy a water filter to clean your drinking water.
Use smaller plates to reduce caloric intake.
Sleep
Buy a good mattress.
Get blackout curtains.
Remove your television from your bedroom.
Productivity
Unsubscribe from emails.
Turn off notifications and mute group chats.
Set your phone to silent.
Use email filters to clear up your inbox.

Delete games and social media apps on your phone.
Happiness
Get a dog.
Move to a friendly, social neighborhood.
General Health
Get vaccinated.
Buy good shoes to avoid back pain.
Buy a supportive chair or standing desk.
Finance
Enroll in an automatic savings plan.
Set up automatic bill pay.
Cut cable service.
Ask service providers to lower your bills.
Of course, there are many ways to automate good habits and eliminate bad
ones. Typically, they involve putting technology to work for you. Technology
can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated into
behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple. It is the most reliable and effective
way to guarantee the right behavior.
This is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too infrequently to
become habitual. Things you have to do monthly or yearly—like rebalancing
your investment portfolio—are never repeated frequently enough to become a
habit, so they benefit in particular from technology “remembering” to do them
for you.
Other examples include:
Medicine: Prescriptions can be automatically refilled.
Personal finance: Employees can save for retirement with an automatic
wage deduction.
Cooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery shopping.
Productivity: Social media browsing can be cut off with a website
blocker.
When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your
effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand over to the
authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage o f
growth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote,
“Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform
without thinking about them.”

Of course, the power of technology can work against us as well. Binge-
watching becomes a habit because you have to put more effort in tostoplooking
at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead of pressing a button to advance to
the next episode, Netflix or YouTube will autoplay it for you. All you have to do
is keep your eyes open.
Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your
smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you can have
food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in
the vast expanse of social media. When the effort required to act on your desires
becomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse
arises at the moment. The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves
jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but
ultimately more rewarding, work.
I often find myself gravitating toward social media during any downtime. If I
feel bored for just a fraction of a second, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to write
off these minor distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time they can
accumulate into a serious issue. The constant tug of “just one more minute” can
prevent me from doing anything of consequence. (I’m not the only one. The
average person spends over two hours per day on social media. What could you
do with an extra six hundred hours per year?)
During the year I was writing this book, I experimented with a new time
management strategy. Every Monday, my assistant would reset the passwords on
all my social media accounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I
worked without distraction. On Friday, she would send me the new passwords. I
had the entire weekend to enjoy what social media had to offer until Monday
morning when she would do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up
with a friend or family member and reset each other’s passwords each week.)
One of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted. Within the first wee k
of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t need to check it
nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day. It had
simply been so easy that it had become the default. Once my bad habit became
impossible, I discovered that Ididactually have the motivation to work on more
meaningful tasks. After I removed the mental candy from my environment, it
became much easier to eat the healthy stuff.
When working in your favor, automation can make your good habits
inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is the ultimate way to lock in future
behavior rather than relying on willpower in the moment. By utilizing
commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and technology, you can
create an environment of inevitability—a space where good habits are not just an

outcome you hope for but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed.
