# Chapter 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-

Minute Rule
TWYLA THARP IS widely regarded as one of the greatest dancers and choreographers
of the modern era. In 1992, she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, often
referred to as the Genius Grant, and she has spent the bulk of her career touring
the globe to perform her original works. She also credits much of her success to
simple daily habits.
“I begin each day of my life with a ritual,” she writes. “I wake up at 5:30
A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweat shirt, and my hat. I
walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the driver to take me to
the Pumping Iron gym at 91st Street and First Avenue, where I work out for two
hours.
“The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body through
each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I tell the driver
where to go I have completed the ritual.
“It’s a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning habitualizes it —
makes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance that I would skip it or do it
differently. It is one more item in my arsenal of routines, and one less thing to
think about.”
Hailing a cab each morning may be a tiny action, but it is a splendid example
of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.
Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are
done out of habit. This is already a substantial percentage, but the true influence
of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are automatic
choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be
completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take
for minutes or hours afterward.
Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path

and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to
be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something
different. You sit through a bad movie for two hours. You keep snacking even
when you’re already full. You check your phone for “just a second” and soon
you have spent twenty minutes staring at the screen. In this way, the habits you
follow without thinking often determine the choices you make when you are
thinking.
Each evening, there is a tiny moment—usually around 5:15 p.m.—that shapes
the rest of my night. My wife walks in the door from work and either we change
into our workout clothes and head to the gym or we crash onto the couch, order
Indian food, and watchThe Office. * Similar to Twyla Tharp hailing the cab, the
ritual is changing into my workout clothes. If I change clothes, I know the
workout will happen. Everything that follows—driving to the gym, deciding
which exercises to do, stepping under the bar—is easy once I’ve taken the first
step.
Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I
refer to these little choices asdecisive moments. The moment you decide
between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. The moment you choose between
driving your car or riding your bike. The moment you decide between starting
your homework or grabbing the video game controller. These choices are a for k
in the road.
## Decisive Moments

FIGURE 14: The difference between a good day and a bad day is often a few productive and healthy choices made at decisive moments. Each one is like a fork in the road, and these choices
stack up throughout the day and can ultimately lead to very different outcomes.
Decisive moments set the options available to your future self. For instance,
walking into a restaurant is a decisive moment because it determines what you’ll
be eating for lunch. Technically, you are in control of what you order, but in a
larger sense, you can only order an item if it is on the menu. If you walk into a
steakhouse, you can get a sirloin or a rib eye, but not sushi. Your options are
constrained by what’s available. They are shaped by the first choice.
We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the
decisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day is made up o f
many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that determine the path
you take. These little choices stack up, each one setting the trajectory for how
you spend the next chunk of time.

Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not the gym.
## The Two-Minute Rule
Even when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too big. When you
dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you end up
trying to do too much too soon. The most effective way I know to counteract this
tendency is to use theTwo-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new
habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”
You’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute
version:
“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”
“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”
“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”
“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”
“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”
The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can
meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away. And,
as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once you’ve started
doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. A new habit should
not feel like a challenge. The actions thatfollowcan be challenging, but the first
two minutes should be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally
leads you down a more productive path.
You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your desired
outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to “very hard.”
For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is hard. Walking
ten thousand steps is moderately difficult. Walking ten minutes is easy. And
putting on your running shoes is very easy. Your goal might be to run a
marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your running shoes. That’s how
you follow the Two-Minute Rule.
Very easy Easy Moderate Hard Very hard
Put on your running shoes Walk ten minutes Walk ten thousand steps Run a 5K Run a marathon
Write one sentence Write one paragraph Write one thousand words Write a five-thousand-word article Write a book
Open your notes Study for ten minutes Study for three hours Get straight A’s Earn a PhD

People often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or
meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one
thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must
be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the basic skill o f
showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. Instead o f
trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more
consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.
As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a
ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely a hack to make
habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you
ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip
into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same
warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of pea k
performance. By following the same creative ritual, you make it easier to get
into the hard work of creating. By developing a consistent power-down habit,
you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night. You may not be
able to automate the whole process, but you can make the first action mindless.
Make it easy to start and the rest will follow.
The Two-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some people. You know that
therealgoal is to do more than just two minutes, so it may feel like you’re
trying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually aspiring to read one page or do one
push-up or open their notes. And if you know it’s a mental trick, why would you
fall for it?
If the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes and then
stop. Go for a run, but youmuststop after two minutes. Start meditating, but you
muststop after two minutes. Study Arabic, but youmuststop after two minutes.
It’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the whole thing. Your habit canonlylast one
hundred and twenty seconds.
One of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundred pounds. In the
beginning, he went to the gym each day, but he told himself he wasn’t allowed
to stay for more than five minutes. He would go to the gym, exercise for five
minutes, and leave as soon as his time was up. After a few weeks, he looked
around and thought, “Well, I’m always coming here anyway. I might as well
start staying a little longer.” A few years later, the weight was gone.
Journaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit from
getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most people give up
after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore. * The
secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work. Greg
McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily

journaling habit by specifically writinglessthan he felt like. He always stopped
journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar
advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are
going good,” he said.
Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the identity
you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row—even if it’s just
for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new identity. You’re not
worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on becoming the type of person
who doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking the smallest action that confirms the
type of person you want to be.
We rarely think about change this way because everyone is consumed by the
end goal. But one push-up is better than not exercising. One minute of guitar
practice is better than none at all. One minute of reading is better than never
picking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.
At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each
day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we callhabi t
shapingto scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. Start by
mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. Then,
advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process—focusing on just the first
two minutes and mastering that stage before moving on to the next level.
Eventually, you’ll end up with the habit you had originally hoped to build while
still keeping your focus where it should be: on the first two minutes of the
behavior.
## Examples Of Habit Shaping
Becoming an Early Riser
Phase 1:Be home by 10 p.m. every night.
Phase 2:Have all devices (TV, phone, etc.) turned off by 10 p.m. every night.
Phase 3:Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night (reading a book, talking with your partner).
Phase 4:Lights off by 10 p.m. every night.
Phase 5:Wake up at 6 a.m. every day.
Becoming Vegan
Phase 1:Start eating vegetables at each meal.
Phase 2:Stop eating animals with four legs (cow, pig, lamb, etc.).
Phase 3:Stop eating animals with two legs (chicken, turkey, etc.).
Phase 4:Stop eating animals with no legs (fish, clams, scallops, etc.).
Phase 5:Stop eating all animal products (eggs, milk, cheese).

Starting to Exercise
Phase 1:Change into workout clothes.
Phase 2:Step out the door (try taking a walk).
Phase 3:Drive to the gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave.
Phase 4:Exercise for fifteen minutes at least once per week.
Phase 5:Exercise three times per week.
Nearly any larger life goal can be transformed into a two-minute behavior. I
want to live a healthy and long life > I need to stay in shape > I need to exercise
> I need to change into my workout clothes. I want to have a happy marriage > I
need to be a good partner > I should do something each day to make my
partner’s life easier > I should meal plan for next week.
Whenever you are struggling to stick with a habit, you can employ the Two-
Minute Rule. It’s a simple way to make your habits easy.

## Chapter Summary
Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your
behavior for minutes or hours afterward.
Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in
the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or
an unproductive one.
The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should
take less than two minutes to do.”
The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it
becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required
to do great things.
Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that
doesn’t exist.
