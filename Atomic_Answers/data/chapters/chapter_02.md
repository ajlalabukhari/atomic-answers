# Chapter 02: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice

Versa)
WHY IS IT so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones? Few things
can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits.
And yet it is likely that this time next year you’ll be doing the same thing rather
than something better.
It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days,
even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits like
exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and
then become a hassle.
However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever
—especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best intentions, unhealthy habits
like eating junk food, watching too much television, procrastinating, and
smoking can feel impossible to break.
Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the
wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. In this
chapter, I’ll address the first point. In the chapters that follow, I’ll answer the
second.
Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. To understand what
I mean, consider that there are three levels at which change can occur. You can
imagine them like the layers of an onion.
## Three Layers Of Behavior Change

FIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.
The first layer is changing your outcomes.This level is concerned with
changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a
championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.
The second layer is changing your process.This level is concerned with
changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym,
decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice.
Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.
The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.This level is
concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your
judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and
biases you hold are associated with this level.
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is
about what you believe. When it comes to building habits that last—when it
comes to building a system of 1 percent improvements—the problem is not that
one level is “better” or “worse” than another. All levels of change are useful in
their own way. The problem is thedirectionof change.
Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing onwha t
they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to
build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing onwhowe
wish to become.

## Outcome-Based Habits
## Identity-Based Habits

FIGURE 4: With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.
Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first
person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable
response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be
something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying
around the same beliefs.
The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a
small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part
of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone
who smokes.
Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to
improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this
diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they

should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their
actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize
that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.
Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of a
democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and social equality.
The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of beliefs like absolute
authority and strict obedience. You can imagine many ways to try to get more
people to vote in a democracy, but such behavior change would never get off the
ground in a dictatorship. That’s not the identity of the system. Voting is a
behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.
A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals, organizations,
or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an
identity behind the habits.
Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more
money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then
you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. You may want
better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment,
you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather than training. It’s hard to change your habits i f
you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have
a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changedwhoyou are.
The story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado, provides a
good example. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve chewed my fingernails,”
Clark told me. “It started as a nervous habit when I was young, and then
morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day, I resolved to stop
chewing my nails until they grew out a bit. Through mindful willpower alone, I
managed to do it.”
Then, Clark did something surprising.
“I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,” he said. “My thought
was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’t chew them. And it
worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was the manicure made
my fingers look really nice for the first time. The manicurist even said that —
other than the chewing—I had really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was
proud of my fingernails. And even though that’s something I had never aspired
to, it made all the difference. I’ve never chewed my nails since; not even a single
close call. And it’s because I now take pride in properly caring for them.”
The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your
identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person whowantsthis. It’s
something very different to say I’m the type of person whoisthis.
The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more

motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud
of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain
it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an
upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more
likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll
fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.
True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because o f
motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part o f
your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy
once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard
to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they
become part of who you are.
The goal is not to read a book, the goal is tobecomea reader.
The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is tobecomea runner.
The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is tobecomea
musician.
Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an
indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or
nonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular
aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.
For example, people who identified as “being a voter” were more likely to vote
than those who simply claimed “voting” was an action they wanted to perform.
Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identity doesn’t have
to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when
your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing
behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already
believe yourself to be.
Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword. When
working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for selfimprovement.
When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse. Once you
have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your
ability to change. Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly
following the norms attached to their identity.

“I’m terrible with directions.”
“I’m not a morning person.”
“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”
“I’m always late.”
“I’m not good with technology.”
“I’m horrible at math.”
. . . and a thousand other variations.
When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into
these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to resist
certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to
maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your
beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.
The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult
it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes
(group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even
if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual,
team, society—is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but i f
they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.
On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too busy
or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run,
however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets
in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your
identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yoursel f
requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your
identity.
This brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and worldview play
such an important role in your behavior, where do they come from in the first
place? How, exactly, is your identity formed? And how can you emphasize new
aspects of your identity that serve you and gradually erase the pieces that hinder
you?
## The Two-Step Process To Changing Your Identity
Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs.
Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through
experience.*

More precisely, your habits are how youembodyyour identity. When you
make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When
you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you
train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.
The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity
associated with that behavior. In fact, the wordidentitywas originally derived
from the Latin wordsessentitas, which meansbeing,andidentidem, which
meansrepeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”
Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have
proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you have
evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour every night,
you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym even when it’s
snowing, you have evidence that you are committed to fitness. The more
evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.
For most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a writer. If you were to as k
any of my high school teachers or college professors, they would tell you I was
an average writer at best: certainly not a standout. When I began my writing
career, I published a new article every Monday and Thursday for the first few
years. As the evidence grew, so did my identity as a writer. I didn’t start out as a
writer. Ibecameone through my habits.
Of course, your habits are not theonlyactions that influence your identity, but
by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most important ones. Each
experience in life modifies your self-image, but it’s unlikely you would consider
yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you
scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence
accumulates and your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-of f
experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with
time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your
identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process o f
becoming yourself.
This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and
deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by
habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.
Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybethisis who I am.” If you finish a
book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading. If you go to the
gym, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If you practice
playing the guitar, perhaps you are the type of person who likes music.
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No
single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the

evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does
not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by
providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually
is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.
Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your
identity. The most practical way to changewhoyou are is to changewhatyou
do.
Each time you write a page, you are a writer.
Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.
Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.
Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.
Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more
important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish
these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the
story you tell yourself begins to change as well.
Of course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to perform a
bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is that you don’t need to be
perfect. In any election, there are going to be votes for both sides. You don’t
need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a majority. It doesn’t
matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your
goal is simply to win the majority of the time.
New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes
you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. I f
nothing changes, nothing is going to change.
It is a simple two-step process:
1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an individual, as
a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to stand for? What are
your principles and values? Who do you wish to become?
These are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to begin—but
they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack abs or to feel less

anxious or to double their salary. That’s fine. Start there and work backward
from the results you want to the type of person who could get those results. As k
yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?” Who is
the type of person that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that
could learn a new language? Who is the type of person that could run a
successful start-up?
For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s
probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from
writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent
and reliable (identity-based).
This process can lead to beliefs like:
“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.”
“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and empathy
they need.”
“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”
Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin
taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a friend who lost
over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy person do?” All day
long, she would use this question as a guide. Would a healthy person walk or
take a cab? Would a healthy person order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she
acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that
person. She was right.
The concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to another key
theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and your
identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of all habits is a
feedback loop (a concept we will explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s
important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than
your results. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not
getting a particular outcome.
## The Real Reason Habits Matter
Identity change is the North Star of habit change. The remainder of this boo k
will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to build better habits in
yourself, your family, your team, your company, and anywhere else you wish.

But the true question is: “Are you becoming the type of person you want to
become?” The first step is notwhatorhow, butwho. You need to know who you
want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And
that’s why we are starting here.
You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not
set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can choose the identity
you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us
to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter.
Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks. It’s not
about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or
wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about achieving external measures o f
success like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can
help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not abouthaving
something. They are aboutbecomingsomeone.
Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type o f
person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your
deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.

## Chapter Summary
There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and
identity change.
The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what
you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the
type of person you wish to become.
Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously
edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better
results (although they can do that), but because they can change your
beliefs about yourself.
