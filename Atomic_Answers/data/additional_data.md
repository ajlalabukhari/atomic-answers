HABITS CREATE THE FOUNDATION FOR MASTERY. In chess, it is only after the basic movements of the
pieces have become automatic that a player can focus on the next level of the
game. Each chunk of information that is memorized opens up the mental space
for more effortful thinking. This is true for any endeavor. When you know the
simple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking, you are
free to pay attention to more advanced details. In this way, habits are the
backbone of any pursuit of excellence.
However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition
develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you
become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes
easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you
stop thinking about how to do it better.
The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside
of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying
attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better because you’re
gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits —
not improving them. In fact, some research has shown that once a skill has been
mastered there is usually a slightdeclinein performance over time.
Usually, this minor dip in performance is no cause for worry. You don’t need
a system to continuously improve how well you brush your teeth or tie your
shoes or make your morning cup of tea. With habits like these, good enough is
usually good enough. The less energy you spend on trivial choices, the more you
can spend it on what really matters.
However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite levels
of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You can’t repeat the same
things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are necessary, but not
sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and

deliberate practice.
Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
To become great, certain skillsdoneed to become automatic. Basketball
players need to be able to dribble without thinking before they can move on to
mastering layups with their nondominant hand. Surgeons need to repeat the first
incision so many times that they could do it with their eyes closed, so that they
can focus on the hundreds of variables that arise during surgery. But after one
habit has been mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and
begin building the next habit.
Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success,
repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as
the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Old tasks
become easier the second time around, but it doesn’t get easier overall because
now you’re pouring your energy into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the
next level of performance. It’s an endless cycle.
## Mastering One Habit
## Mastering A Field

FIGURE 16: The process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been
reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.
Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain conscious o f
your performance over time, so you can continue to refine and improve. It is
precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill —
right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming
comfortable—that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency.
The solution? Establish a system for reflection and review.
## How To Review Your Habits And Make Adjustments
In 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most talented basketball teams
ever assembled, but they are rarely remembered that way. The team started the
1985–1986 NBA season with an astounding 29–5 record. “The pundits were
saying that we might be the best team in the history of basketball,” head coach
Pat Riley said after the season. Surprisingly, the Lakers stumbled in the 1986
playoffs and suffered a season-ending defeat in the Western Conference Finals.
The “best team in the history of basketball” didn’t even play for the NBA
championship.
After that blow, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent his players
had and about how much promise his team held. He didn’t want to see flashes o f
brilliance followed by a gradual fade in performance. He wanted the Lakers to

play up to their potential, night after night. In the summer of 1986, he created a
plan to do exactly that, a system that he called the Career Best Effort program or
## Cbe.
“When players first join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we track their
basketball statistics all the way back to high school. I call this Taking Their
Number. We look for an accurate gauge of what a player can do, then build him
into our plan for the team, based on the notion that he will maintain and then
improve upon his averages.”
After determining a player’s baseline level of performance, Riley added a key
step. He asked each player to “improve their output by at least 1 percent over the
course of the season. If they succeeded, it would be a CBE, or Career Best
Effort.” Similar to the British Cycling team that we discussed in Chapter 1, the
Lakers sought peak performance by getting slightly better each day.
Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points or
statistics but about giving your “best effort spiritually and mentally and
physically.” Players got credit for “allowing an opponent to run into you when
you know that a foul will be called against him, diving for loose balls, going
after rebounds whether you are likely to get them or not, helping a teammate
when the player he’s guarding has surged past him, and other ‘unsung hero’
deeds.”
As an example, let’s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers star player at the
time—had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5 turnovers in a game.
Magic also got credit for an “unsung hero” deed by diving after a loose ball (+1).
Finally, he played a total of 33 minutes in this imaginary game.
The positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, we subtract
the 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29. Finally, we divide 29 by 33 minutes played.
29/33 = 0.879
Magic’s CBE number here would be 879. This number was calculated for all
of a player’s games, and it was the average CBE that a player was asked to
improve by 1 percent over the season. Riley compared each player’s current
CBE to not only their past performances but also those of other players in the
league. As Riley put it, “We rank team members alongside league opponents
who play the same position and have similar role definitions.”
Sportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted the top performers in
the league in bold lettering on the blackboard each week and measured them

against the corresponding players on his own roster. Solid, reliable players
generally rated a score in the 600s, while elite players scored at least 800. Magic
Johnson, who submitted 138 triple-doubles in his career, often scored over
1,000.”
The Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by making historical
comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “We stacked the month of November
1986, next to November 1985, and showed the players whether they were doing
better or worse than at the same point last season. Then we showed them how
their performance figures for December 1986, stacked up against November’s.”
The Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, they were
NBA champions. The following year, Pat Riley led his team to another title as
the Lakers became the first team in twenty years to win back-to-back NBA
championships. Afterward, he said, “Sustaining an effort is the most important
thing for any enterprise. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things
right, then do them the same way every time.”
The CBE program is a prime example of the power of reflection and review.
The Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get the most out of what
they had, and made sure their habits improved rather than declined.
Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits
because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible
paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create
rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining
whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday.
Top performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection and review,
and the process doesn’t have to be complex. Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge is
one of the greatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic gold medalist. He
still takes notes after every practice in which he reviews his training for the day
and searches for areas that can be improved. Similarly, gold medal swimmer
Katie Ledecky records her wellness on a scale of 1 to 10 and includes notes on
her nutrition and how well she slept. She also records the times posted by other
swimmers. At the end of each week, her coach goes over her notes and adds his
thoughts.
It’s not just athletes, either. When comedian Chris Rock is preparing fresh
material, he will first appear at small nightclubs dozens of times and test
hundreds of jokes. He brings a notepad on stage and records which bits go over
well and where he needs to make adjustments. The few killer lines that survive
will form the backbone of his new show.
I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which
they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and

what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each
month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong. *
Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine-tuning them.
Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and
make course corrections whenever necessary—like Pat Riley adjusting the effort
of his players on a nightly basis. You don’t want to keep practicing a habit if it
becomes ineffective.
Personally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review. Each
December, I perform anAnnual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. I
tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how
many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more. * Then, I
reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions:
1. What went well this year?
2. What didn’t go so well this year?
3. What did I learn?
Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct anIntegrity Report.
Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report helps me realize
where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use it as a time to
revisit my core values and consider whether I have been living in accordance
with them. This is when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward
being the type of person I wish to become. *
My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:
1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?
2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?
3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?
These two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours per year—but they
are crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradual slide that happens
when I don’t pay close attention. They provide an annual reminder to revisit my
desired identity and consider how my habits are helping me become the type o f
person I wish to be. They indicate when I should upgrade my habits and take on
new challenges and when I should dial my efforts back and focus on the
fundamentals.

Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful
because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice
is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every
imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture. There is too much feedback.
Conversely, never reviewing your habits is like never looking in the mirror. You
aren’t aware of easily fixable flaws—a spot on your shirt, a bit of food in your
teeth. There is too little feedback. Periodic reflection and review is like viewing
yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the important
changes you should make without losing sight of the bigger picture. You want to
view the entire mountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley.
Finally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most
important aspects of behavior change: identity.
## How To Break The Beliefs That Hold You Back
In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your
desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same
beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When working against
you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to deny your
weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. This is one of the greatest
downsides of building habits.
The more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to our
identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. You see this in
every industry. The schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching methods and
sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans. The veteran manager who is
committed to doing things “his way.” The surgeon who dismisses the ideas o f
her younger colleagues. The band who produces a mind-blowing first album and
then gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes
to grow beyond it.
One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an
overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul Graham,
“keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define you, the less
capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie everything up in
being the point guard or the partner at the firm or whatever else, then the loss o f
that facet of your life will wreck you. If you’re a vegan and then develop a
health condition that forces you to change your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis
on your hands. When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle.
Lose that one thing and you lose yourself.

For most of my young life, being an athlete was a major part of my identity.
After my baseball career ended, I struggled to find myself. When you spend your
whole life defining yourself in one way and that disappears, who are you now?
Military veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings. If your
identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,” what happens when
your period of service ends? For many business owners, their identity is
something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the founder.” If you have
spent every waking moment working on your business, how will you feel after
you sell the company?
The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that
you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role
changes.
“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally
tough and loves a physical challenge.”
“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who is
disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”
“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and
creates things.”
When chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than brittle. Like
water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with the changing
circumstances rather than against them.
The following quote from theTao Te Chingencapsulates the ideas perfectly:
Men are born soft and supple;
dead, they are stiff and hard.
Plants are born tender and pliant;
dead, they are brittle and dry.
Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible
is a disciple of death.
Whoever is soft and yielding
is a disciple of life.
The hard and stiff will be broken.
The soft and supple will prevail.

## —Lao Tzu
Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us
into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world is
shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so
you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still
serving you.
A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.

## Chapter Summary
The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The
downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.
Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious
of your performance over time.
The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow
beyond it.

Conclusion
The Secret to Results That Last
THERE IS AN ancient Greek parable known as the Sorites Paradox, * which talks about
the effect one small action can have when repeated enough times. One
formulation of the paradox goes as follows: Can one coin make a person rich? I f
you give a person a pile of ten coins, you wouldn’t claim that he or she is rich.
But what if you add another? And another? And another? At some point, you
will have to admit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him or her
so.
We can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny change transform your
life? It’s unlikely you would say so. But what if you made another? And
another? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that your life was
transformed by one small change.
The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement, but a
thousand of them. It’s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a
fundamental unit of the overall system.
In the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless because
they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one coin won’t make
you rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or reading one page
each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable difference.
Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of one
another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like adding a grain
of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your favor.
Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier
to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working for you rather
than against you.
Over the course of this book, we’ve looked at dozens of stories about top
performers. We’ve heard about Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists,
business leaders, lifesaving physicians, and star comedians who have all used the
science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.
Each of the people, teams, and companies we have covered has faced different
circumstances, but ultimately progressed in the same way: through a
commitment to tiny, sustainable, unrelenting improvements.

Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to
improve, an endless process to refine. In Chapter 1, I said, “If you’re having
trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system.
Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to
change, but because you have the wrong system for change.”
As this book draws to a close, I hope the opposite is true. With the Four Laws
of Behavior Change, you have a set of tools and strategies that you can use to
build better systems and shape better habits. Sometimes a habit will be hard to
remember and you’ll need tomake it obvious. Other times you won’t feel like
starting and you’ll need tomake it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a
habit will be too difficult and you’ll need tomake it easy. And sometimes, you
won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need tomake it satisfying.
Behaviors are effortless here. Behaviors are difficult here.
Obvious Invisible
Attractive Unattractive
Easy Hard
Satisfying Unsatisfying
You want to push your good habits toward the left side of the spectrum by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Meanwhile, you want to cluster your bad habits toward the
right side by making them invisible, unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying.
This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent
solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four
Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next bottleneck.Make it obvious.
Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying.Round and round. Always
looking for the next way to get 1 percent better.
The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements.
It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop. It’s remarkable the
business you can build if you don’t stop working. It’s remarkable the body you
can build if you don’t stop training. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build
if you don’t stop learning. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t
stop saving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop
caring. Small habits don’t add up. They compound.
That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results.

Little Lessons from the Four Laws
IN THIS BOOK , I have introduced a four-step model for human behavior: cue, craving,
response, reward. This framework not only teaches us how to create new habits
but also reveals some interesting insights about human behavior.
Problem phase
1. Cue
2. Craving
Solution phase
3. Response
4. Reward
In this section, I have compiled some lessons (and a few bits of common
sense) that are confirmed by the model. The purpose of these examples is to
clarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework is when describing
human behavior. Once you understand the model, you’ll see examples of it
everywhere.
Awareness comes before desire.A craving is created when you assign
meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your
current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed
an opportunity.
Happiness is simply the absence of desire.When you observe a cue, but do
not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation.
Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction),
but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently.
Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state.
However, happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along. As
Caed Budris says, “Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and
a new desire forming.” Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a
change in state and getting it.
It is theideaof pleasure that we chase.We seek the image of pleasure that
we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what it will be

like to attain that image (or even if it will satisfy us). The feeling of satisfaction
only comes afterward. This is what the Austrian neurologist Victor Frankl meant
when he said that happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is pursued.
Pleasure ensues from action.
Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems.The
first step in any behavior is observation. You notice a cue, a bit of information,
an event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then you are at peace.
Craving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without craving is the
realization that you do not need to fix anything. Your desires are not running
rampant. You do not crave a change in state. Your mind does not generate a
problem for you to solve. You’re simply observing and existing.
With a big enoughwhyyou can overcome anyhow.Friedrich Nietzsche,
the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “He who has a why to live
for can bear almost any how.” This phrase harbors an important truth about
human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is,whyare
you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving
can power great action—even when friction is high.
Being curious is better than being smart.Being motivated and curious
counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will
never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not
intelligence, that prompts behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing
anything is first cultivating a desire for it.”
Emotions drive behavior.Every decision is an emotional decision at some
level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel
compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to
emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action but still
will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why
craving comesbeforeresponse. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.
We can only be rational and logicalafterwe have been emotional.The
primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first
response—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is optimized for feeling
and anticipating. Our second response—the slow, conscious portion of the brain
—is the part that does the “thinking.”
Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) versus
System 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality
only intervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two are aligned, but
it results in illogical and emotional thinking when they are not.
Your response tends to follow your emotions.Our thoughts and actions are
rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is logical. Two people

can notice the same set of facts and respond very differently because they run
those facts through their unique emotional filter. This is one reason why
appealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason. If a
topic makes someone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in the data.
This is why emotions can be such a threat to wise decision making.
Put another way: most people believe that the reasonable response is the one
that benefits them: the one that satisfies their desires. To approach a situation
from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your response on the
data rather than the emotion.
Suffering drives progress.The source of all suffering is the desire for a
change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your
state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity
to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level.
With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied
but lack ambition.
Your actions reveal how badly you want something.If you keep saying
something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s
time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true
motivations.
Reward is on the other side of sacrifice.Response (sacrifice of energy)
always precedes reward (the collection of resources). The “runner’s high” only
comes after the hard run. The reward only comes after the energy is spent.
Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying.A reward is an outcome
that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting
our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy
your craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-
control requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy it.
Our expectations determine our satisfaction.The gap between our cravings
and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking action. If the
mismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise and delight),
then we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the future. If the mismatch is
negative (disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so.
For example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If you
expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your expectation changes
your satisfaction. An average experience preceded by high expectations is a
disappointment. An average experience preceded by low expectations is a
delight. When liking and wanting are approximately the same, you feel satisfied.
Satisfaction = Liking Wanting

Satisfaction = Liking – Wanting
This is the wisdom behind Seneca’s famous quote, “Being poor is not having
too little, it is wanting more.” If your wants outpace your likes, you’ll always be
unsatisfied. You’re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the
solution.
Happiness is relative. When I first began sharing my writing publicly it too k
me three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I hit that milestone, I
told my parents and my girlfriend. We celebrated. I felt excited and motivated. A
few years later, I realized that one thousand people were signing up each day.
And yet I didn’t even think to tell anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results
ninety times faster than before but experiencing little pleasure over it. It wasn’t
until a few days later that I realized how absurd it was that I wasn’t celebrating
something that would have seemed like a pipe dream just a few years before.
The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation.When desire is
high, it hurts to notlikethe outcome. Failing to attain something you want hurts
more than failing to attain something you didn’t think much about in the first
place. This is why people say, “I don’t want to get my hopes up.”
Feelings come both before and after the behavior.Before acting, there is a
feeling that motivates you to act—the craving. After acting, there is a feeling
that teaches you to repeat the action in the future—the reward.
Cue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling)
How we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we feel.
Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains.Wanting and liking are the two drivers o f
behavior. If it’s not desirable, you have no reason to do it. Desire and craving are
what initiate a behavior. But if it’s not enjoyable, you have no reason to repeat it.
Pleasure and satisfaction are what sustain a behavior. Feeling motivated gets you
to act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.
Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance.The first
time an opportunity arises, there is hope of what could be. Your expectation
(cravings) is based solely onpromise. The second time around, your expectation
is grounded in reality. You begin to understand how the process works and your
hope is gradually traded for a more accurate prediction and acceptance of the
likely outcome.
This is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick or

weight-loss scheme. New plans offer hope because we don’t have any
experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more appealing
than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. As Aristotle noted,
“Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.” Perhaps this can be
revised to “Youth is easily deceived because it only hopes.” There is no
experience to root the expectation in. In the beginning, hope is all you have.

How to Apply These Ideas to Business
OVER THE YEARS , I’ve spoken at Fortune 500 companies and growing start-ups about
how to apply the science of small habits to run more effective businesses and
build better products. I’ve compiled many of the most practical strategies into a
short bonus chapter. I think you’ll find it to be an incredibly useful addition to
the main ideas mentioned inAtomic Habits.

How to Apply These Ideas to Parenting
ONE OF THE most common questions I hear from readers is something along the
lines of, “How can I get my kids to do this stuff?” The ideas inAtomic Habits
are intended to apply broadly to all of human behavior (teenagers are humans,
too), which means you should find plenty of useful strategies in the main text.
That said, parenting does face its own set of challenges. As a bonus chapter, I’ve
put together a brief guide on how to apply these ideas specifically to parenting.

Acknowledgments
I HAVE RELIED HEAVILY on others during the creation of this book. Before anyone else, I
must thank my wife, Kristy, who has been indispensable throughout this process.
She has played every role a person can play in the writing of a book: spouse,
friend, fan, critic, editor, researcher, therapist. It is no exaggeration to say this
book would not be the same without her. It might not exist at all. Like
everything in our life, we did it together.
Second, I am grateful to my family, not only for their support and
encouragement on this book but also for believing in me no matter what project I
happen to be working on. I have benefited from many years of support from my
parents, grandparents, and siblings. In particular, I want my mom and dad to
know that I love them. It is a special feeling to know that your parents are your
greatest fans.
Third, to my assistant, Lyndsey Nuckols. At this point, her job defies
description as she has been asked to do nearly everything one could imagine for
a small business. Thankfully, her skills and talents are more powerful than my
questionable management style. Some sections of this book are as much hers as
they are mine. I am deeply grateful for her help.
As for the content and writing of the book, I have a long list of people to
thank. To start, there are a few people from whom I have learned so much that it
would be a crime to not mention them by name. Leo Babauta, Charles Duhigg,
Nir Eyal, and BJ Fogg have each influenced my thoughts on habits in
meaningful ways. Their work and ideas can be found sprinkled throughout this
text. If you enjoyed this book, I’d encourage you to read their writing as well.
At various stages of writing, I benefited from the guidance of many fine
editors. Thanks to Peter Guzzardi for walking me through the early stages of the
writing process and for a kick in the pants when I really needed it. I am indebted
to Blake Atwood and Robin Dellabough for transforming my ugly and insanely
long first drafts into a tight, readable manuscript. And I am thankful to Anne
Barngrover for her ability to add a little class and poetic style to my writing.
I’d like to thank the many people who read early versions of the manuscript,
including Bruce Ammons, Darcey Ansell, Tim Ballard, Vishal Bhardwaj,
Charlotte Blank, Jerome Burt, Sim Campbell, Al Carlos, Nicky Case, Julie
Chang, Jason Collins, Debra Croy, Roger Dooley, Tiago Forte, Matt Gartland,

Andrew Gierer, Randy Giffen, Jon Giganti, Adam Gilbert, Stephan Guyenet,
Jeremy Hendon, Jane Horvath, Joakim Jansson, Josh Kaufman, Anne Kavanagh,
Chris Klaus, Zeke Lopez, Cady Macon, Cyd Madsen, Kiera McGrath, Amy
Mitchell, Anna Moise, Stacey Morris, Tara-Nicholle Nelson, Taylor Pearson,
Max Shank, Trey Shelton, Jason Shen, Jacob Zangelidis, and Ari Zelmanow.
The book benefited greatly from your feedback.
To the team at Avery and Penguin Random House who made this book a
reality, thank you. I owe a debt of special thanks to my publisher, Megan
Newman, for her endless patience as I continually pushed back deadlines. She
gave me the space I needed to create a book I was proud of and championed my
ideas at every step. To Nina, for her ability to transform my writing while still
retaining my original message. To Lindsay, Farin, Casey, and the rest of the
PRH team for spreading the message of this book to more people than I could
ever reach on my own. To Pete Garceau, for designing a beautiful cover for this
book.
And to my agent, Lisa DiMona, for her guidance and insight at every step o f
the publishing process.
To the many friends and family members who asked “How’s the boo k
going?” and offered a word of encouragement when I inevitably replied
“Slowly”—thank you. Every author faces a few dark moments when writing a
book, and one kind word can be enough to get you to show up again the next
day.
I am sure there are people I have forgotten, but I keep an updated list o f
anyone who has influenced my thinking in meaningful ways at
jamesclear.com/thanks.
And finally, to you. Life is short and you have shared some of your precious
time with me by reading this book. Thank you.

Notes
IN THIS SECTION , I have included a detailed list of notes, references, and citations for
each chapter in the book. I trust that most readers will find this list to be
sufficient. However, I also realize that scientific literature changes over time and
the references for this book may need to be updated. Furthermore, I fully expect
that I have made a mistake somewhere in this book—either in attributing an idea
to the wrong person or not giving credit to someone where it is due. (If you
believe this to be the case, please email me at james@jamesclear.com so I can
fix the issue as soon as possible.)
In addition to the notes below, you can find a full list of updated endnotes and
corrections at atomichabits.com/endnotes.

## Introduction
We all deal with setbacks :What about luck, you might ask? Luck matters, certainly. Habits are not the only thing that influence your success, but they are probably the most important factor that is
within your control. And the only selfimprovement strategy that makes any sense is to focus on what you can control.

you’ll end up thirty-seven times better :Jason Shen, an entrepreneur and writer, received an early look at this book. After reading this chapter, he remarked: “If the gains were linear, you’d predict to be
3.65x better off. But because it is exponential, the improvement is actually 10x greater.” April 3, 2018.
Habits are the compound interest :Many people have noted how habits multiply over time. Here are some of my favorite articles and books on the subject: Leo Babauta, “The Power of Habit
Investments,” Zen Habits, January 28, 2013, https://zenhabits.net/bank; Morgan Housel, “The Freakishly Strong Base,” Collaborative Fund, October 31, 2017,

http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity.
Habits are a double-edged sword :I’d like to credit Jason Hreha with originally describing habits to me in this way. Jason Hreha (@jhreha), “They’re a double edged sword,” Twitter, February 21,
2018, https://twitter.com/jhreha/status/966430907371433984.
The more tasks you can handle without thinking :Michael (@mmay3r), “The foundation of productivity is habits. The more you do automatically, the more you’re subsequently freed to do. This effect
compounds,” Twitter, April 10, 2018, https://twitter.com/mmay3r/status/983837519274889216.
each book you read not only teaches :This idea—that learning new ideas increases the value of your old ideas—is something I first heard about from Patrick O’Shaughnessy, who writes, “This is why
knowledge compounds. Old stuff that was a 4/10 in value can become a 10/10, unlocked by another book in the future.” http://investorfieldguide.com/reading-tweet-storm.

Inspiration for this drawing came from a tweet titled “Deception of linear vs exponential” by @MlichaelW. May 19, 2018. https://twitter.com/MlichaelW/status/997878086132817920.
The seed of every habit :This paragraph was inspired by a quote from Mr. Mircea, an account on Twitter, who wrote, “each habit began its life as a single decision.” https://twitter.com/mistermircea.
the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers :Hat tip to CrossFit coach Ben Bergeron for inspiring this quote during a conversation I had with him on February 28, 2017.
You fall to the level of your systems :This line was inspired by the following quote from Archilochus: “We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training.”

## Chapter 2
You can imagine them like the layers of an onion :Hat tip to Simon Sinek. His “Golden Circle” framework is similar in design, but discusses different topics. For more, see Simon Sinek,Start with
Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action(London: Portfolio/Penguin, 2013), 37.
I resolved to stop chewing my nails :The quotes used in this section are presented as a conversation for reading clarity, but were originally written by Clark. See: Brian Clark, “The Powerful
Psychological Boost that Helps You Make and Break Habits,” Further, November 14, 2017, https://further.net/pride-habits.
Research has shown that once a person :Christopher J. Bryan et al., “Motivating Voter Turnout by Invoking the Self,”Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences108, no. 31 (2011): 12653 –
12656.
There is internal pressure :Leon Festinger,A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance(Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1957).
Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness” :Technically,identidemis a word belonging to the Late Latin language. Also, thanks to Tamar Shippony, a reader of jamesclear.com, who
originally told me about the etymology of the wordidentity, which she looked up in the American Heritage Dictionary.
We change bit by bit :This is another reason atomic habits are such an effective form of change. If you change your identity too quickly and become someone radically different overnight, then you feel
as if you lose your sense of self. But if you update and expand your identity gradually, you will find yourself reborn into someone totally new and yet still familiar. Slowly—habit by habit,
vote by vote—you become accustomed to your new identity. Atomic habits and gradual improvement are the keys to identity change without identity loss.

The psychologist Gary Klein :I originally heard about this story from Daniel Kahneman, but it was confirmed by Gary Klein in an email on March 30, 2017. Klein also covers the story in his own book,

“Until you make the unconscious conscious” :Although this quote by Jung is popular, I had trouble tracking down the original source. It’s probably a paraphrase of this passage: “The psychological
rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner
opposite, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves.” For more, see C. G. Jung,Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self(Princeton, NJ:

many ways to use implementation intentions :For the termhabit stacking, I am indebted to S. J. Scott, who wrote a book by the same name. From what I understand, his concept is slightly different,
but I like the term and thought it appropriate to use in this chapter. Previous writers such as Courtney Carver and Julien Smith have also used the termhabit stacking, but in different
contexts.
The French philosopher Denis Diderot :“Denis Diderot,”New World Encyclopedia, http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Denis_Diderot, last modified October 26, 2017.
acquired a scarlet robe :Encyclopædia Britannica, vol. 8 (1911), s.v. “Denis Diderot.” Diderot’s scarlet robe is frequently described as a gift from a friend. However, I could find no original source
claiming it was a gift nor any mention of the friend who supplied the robe. If you happen to know any historians specializing in robe acquisitions, feel free to point them my way so we can
clarify the mystery of the source of Diderot’s famous scarlet robe.

The Diderot Effect states :Juliet Schor,The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don’t Need(New York: HarperPerennial, 1999).
which was created by BJ Fogg :In this chapter, I used the termhabit stackingto refer to linking a new habit to an old one. For this idea, I give credit to BJ Fogg. In his work, Fogg uses the term
anchoringto describe this approach because your old habit acts as an “anchor” that keeps the new one in place. No matter what term you prefer, I believe it is a very effective strategy. You
can learn more about Fogg’s work and his Tiny Habits Method at https://www.tinyhabits.com.

choose products not because of what they are :Multiple research studies have shown that the mere sight of food can make us feel hungry even when we don’t have actual physiological hunger.
According to one researcher, “dietary behaviors are, in large part, the consequence of automatic responses to contextual food cues.” For more, see D. A. Cohen and S. H. Babey,

Evans-Pritchard, “Aiming to Reduce Cleaning Costs,”Works That Work, Winter 2013, https://worksthatwork.com/1/urinal-fly.
sleeping . . . was the only action that happened in that room :“Techniques involving stimulus control have even been successfully used to help people with insomnia. In short, those who had trouble
falling asleep were told to only go to their room and lie in their bed when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to get up and change rooms. Strange advice, but over
time, researchers found that by associating the bed with ‘It’s time to go to sleep’ and not with other activities (reading a book, just lying there, etc.), participants were eventually able to
quickly fall asleep due to the repeated process: it became almost automatic to fall asleep in their bed because a successful trigger had been created.” For more, see Charles M. Morin et al.,

The importance of dopamine :“The importance of dopamine was discovered by accident. In 1954, James Olds and Peter Milner, two neuroscientists at McGill University, decided to implant an
electrode deep into the center of a rat’s brain. The precise placement of the electrode was largely happenstance; at the time, the geography of the mind remained a mystery. But Olds and
Milner got lucky. They inserted the needle right next to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a part of the brain that generates pleasurable feelings. Whenever you eat a piece of chocolate cake,
or listen to a favorite pop song, or watch your favorite team win the World Series, it is your NAcc that helps you feel so happy. But Olds and Milner quickly discovered that too much
pleasure can be fatal. They placed the electrodes in several rodents’ brains and then ran a small current into each wire, making the NAccs continually excited. The scientists noticed that the
rodents lost interest in everything. They stopped eating and drinking. All courtship behavior ceased. The rats would just huddle in the corners of their cages, transfixed by their bliss. Within
days, all of the animals had perished. They died of thirst. For more, see Jonah Lehrer,How We Decide(Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009).

## Chapter 11
In the end, they had little to show for their efforts :This story comes from page 29 ofArt & Fearby David Bayles and Ted Orland. In an email conversation with Orland on October 18, 2016, he
explained the origins of the story. “Yes, the ‘ceramics story’ in ‘Art & Fear’ is indeed true, allowing for some literary license in the retelling. Its real-world origin was as a gambit employed
by photographer Jerry Uelsmann to motivate his Beginning Photography students at the University of Florida. As retold in ‘Art & Fear’ it faithfully captures the scene as Jerry told it to me
—except I replaced photography with ceramics as the medium being explored. Admittedly, it would’ve been easier to retain photography as the art medium being discussed, but David
Bayles (co-author) & I are both photographers ourselves, and at the time we were consciously trying to broaden the range of media being referenced in the text. The intriguing thing to me
is that it hardly matters what art form was invoked—the moral of the story appears to hold equally true straight across the whole art spectrum (and even outside the arts, for that matter).”
Later in that same email, Orland said, “You have our permission to reprint any or all of the ‘ceramics’ passage in your forthcoming book.” In the end, I settled on publishing an adapted
version, which combines their telling of the ceramics story with facts from the original source of Uelsmann’s photography students. David Bayles and Ted Orland,Art & Fear:

thirty-five thousand years ago. Simon Neubauer, Jean-Jacques Hublin, and Philipp Gunz, “The Evolution of Modern Human Brain Shape,”Science Advances4, no. 1 (2018): eaao5961.
society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment :The original research on this topic used the termsdelayed-return societiesandimmediate-return societies. James Woodburn,
“Egalitarian Societies,”Man17, no. 3 (1982), doi:10.2307/2801707. I first heard of the difference between immediate-return environments and delayed-return environments in a lecture
from Mark Leary. Mark Leary,Understanding the Mysteries of Human Behavior(Chantilly, VA: Teaching, 2012).
The world has changed much in recent years :The rapid environmental changes of recent centuries have far outpaced our biological ability to adapt. On average, it takes about twenty-five thousand
years for meaningful genetic changes to be selected for in a human population. For more, see Edward O. Wilson,Sociobiology(Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 1980), 151.

Disease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks, even years :The topics of irrational behavior and cognitive biases have become quite popular in recent years. However, many actions thatseem

Future You:Hat tip to behavioral economist Daniel Goldstein, who said, “It’s an unequal battle between the present self and the future self. I mean, let’s face it, the present self is present. It’s in control.
It’s in power right now. It has these strong, heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth. And the future self is not even around. It’s off in the future. It’s weak. It doesn’t even have
a lawyer present. There’s nobody to stick up for the future self. And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams.” For more, see Daniel Goldstein, “The Battle between Your Present
and Future Self,” TEDSalon NY2011, November 2011, video, https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_goldstein_the_battle_between_your_present_and_future_self.

The most effective form of motivation is progress :This line is paraphrased from Greg McKeown, who wrote, “Research has shown that of all forms of human motivation the most effective one is
progress.” Greg McKeown,Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less(Currency, 2014).
The first mistake is never the one that ruins you :In fact, research has shown that missing a habit once has virtually no impact on the odds of developing a habit over the long-term, regardless of when
the mistake occurs. As long as you get back on track, you’re fine. See: Phillippa Lally et al., “How Are Habits Formed: Modelling Habit Formation in the Real World,”European Journal
of Social Psychology40, no. 6 (2009), doi:10.1002/ejsp.674.
Missing once is an accident :“Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.” I swear I read this line somewhere or perhaps paraphrased it from something similar, but despite my
best efforts all of my searches for a source are coming up empty. Maybe I came up with it, but my best guess is it belongs to an unidentified genius instead.

Genes have been shown to influence everything :“All traits are heritable” is a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much. Concrete behavioral traits that patently depend on content provided by the home
or culture are, of course, not heritable at all; which language you speak, which religion you worship in, which political party you belong to. But behavioral traits that reflect the underlying
talents and temperaments are heritable: how proficient with language you are, how religious, how liberal or conservative. General intelligence is heritable, and so are the five major ways in
which personality can vary . . . openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion-introversion, antagonism-agreeableness, and neuroticism. And traits that are surprisingly specific
turn out to be heritable, too, such as dependence on nicotine or alcohol, number of hours of television watched, and likelihood of divorcing. Thomas J. Bouchard, “Genetic Influence on

## Little Lessons From The Four Laws
“Happiness is the space between one desire” :Caed (@caedbudris), “Happiness is the space between desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming,” Twitter, November 10, 2017,
https://twitter.com/caedbudris/status/929042389930594304.
happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue :Frankl’s full quotation is as follows: “Don’t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like
happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s
surrender to a person other than oneself.” For more, see Viktor E. Frankl,Man’s Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy(Boston: Beacon Press, 1962).
“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how” :Friedrich Nietzsche and Oscar Levy,The Twilight of the Idols(Edinburgh: Foulis, 1909).
The feeling comes first (System 1) :Daniel Kahneman,Thinking, Fast and Slow(New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2015).
appealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason :“If you wish to persuade, appeal to interest, rather than reason” (Benjamin Franklin).
Satisfaction = Liking−Wanting :This is similar to David Meister’s fifth law of service businesses: Satisfaction = perception−expectation.
“Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more” :Lucius Annaeus Seneca and Anna Lydia Motto,Moral Epistles(Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1985).
As Aristotle noted :It is debated whether Aristotle actually said this. The quote has been attributed to him for centuries, but I could find no primary source for the phrase.

- As this book was going to print, new information about the British Cycling
team has come out. You can see my thoughts at atomichabits.com/cycling.
- I geeked out and actually calculated this. Washington, D.C., is about 225 miles
from New York City. Assuming you are flying on a 747 or an Airbus A380,
changing the heading by 3.5 degrees as you leave Los Angeles likely causes the
nose of the airplane to shift between 7.2 to 7.6 feet, or about 86 to 92 inches. A
very small shift in direction can lead to a very meaningful change in destination.

- The termsunconscious,nonconscious, andsubconsciouscan all be used to
describe the absence of awareness or thought. Even in academic circles, these
words are often used interchangeably without much nitpicking (for once).
Nonconsciousis the term I’m going to use because it is broad enough to
encompass both the processes of the mind we could never consciously access
and the moments when we are simply not paying attention to what surrounds us.
Nonconsciousis a description of anything you are not consciously thinking
about.
- Certainly, there are some aspects of your identity that tend to remain
unchanged over time—like identifying as someone who is tall or short. But even
for more fixed qualities and characteristics, whether you view them in a positive
or negative light is determined by your experiences throughout life.

- Readers ofThe Power of Habitby Charles Duhigg will recognize these terms.
Duhigg wrote a great book and my intention is to pick up where he left off by
integrating these stages into four simple laws you can apply to build better habits
in life and work.
- Charles Duhigg and Nir Eyal deserve special recognition for their influence on
this image. This representation of the habit loop is a combination of language
that was popularized by Duhigg’s book,The Power of Habit, and a design that
was popularized by Eyal’s book,Hooked.

- When I visited Japan, I saw this strategy save a woman’s life. Her young son
stepped onto the Shinkansen, one of Japan’s famous bullet trains that travel at
over two hundred miles per hour, just as the doors were closing. She was left
outside on the platform and jammed her arm through the door to grab him. With
her arm stuck in the door, the train was about to take off, but right before it
pulled away an employee performed a safety check by Pointing-and-Calling up
and down the platform. In less than five seconds, he noticed the woman and
managed to stop the train from leaving. The door opened, the woman—now in
tears—ran to her son, and a minute later the train departed safely.

atomichabits.com/scorecard.

- In addition to her payment for the library, Catherine the Great asked Diderot to
keep the books until she needed them and offered to pay him a yearly salary to
act as her librarian.
- Fogg refers to this strategy as the “Tiny Habits recipe,” but I'll call it the habit
stacking formula throughout the book.

- If you’re looking for more examples and guidance, you can download a Habit
Stacking template at atomichabits.com/habitstacking.
- Dopamine is not theonlychemical that influences your habits. Every behavior
involves multiple brain regions and neurochemicals, and anyone who claims that
“habits are all about dopamine” is skipping over major portions of the process. It
is just one of the important role players in habit formation. However, I will
single out the dopamine circuit in this chapter because it provides a window into
the biological underpinnings of desire, craving, and motivation that are behind
every habit.

- I’m so happy I was able to fit aGame of Thronesreference into this book.
- This is just a partial list of underlying motives. I offer a more complete list and
more examples of how to apply them to business at atomichabits.com/business.

- A similar story is told in the bookArt & Fearby David Bayles and Ted
Orland. It has been adapted here with permission. See the endnotes for a full
explanation.
- This is a foundational principle in physics, where it is known as the Principle
of Least Action. It states that the path followed between any two points will
always be the path requiring the least energy. This simple principle underpins
the laws of the universe. From this one idea, you can describe the laws of motion
and relativity.

- The phraseaddition by subtractionis also used by teams and businesses to
describe removing people from a group in order to make the team stronger
overall.
- To be fair, this still sounds like an amazing night.

- I designed a habit journal specifically to make journaling easier. It includes a
“One Line Per Day” section where you simply write one sentence about your
day. You can learn more at atomichabits.com/journal.
- The irony of how closely this story matches my process of writing this book is
not lost on me. Although my publisher was much more accommodating, and my
closet remained full, I did feel like I had to place myself on house arrest to finish
the manuscript.

- This is also referred to as a “Ulysses pact” or a “Ulysses contract.” Named
after Ulysses, the hero ofThe Odyssey, who told his sailors to tie him to the mast
of the ship so that he could hear the enchanting song of the Sirens but wouldn’t
be able to steer the ship toward them and crash on the rocks. Ulysses realized the
benefits of locking in your future actions while your mind is in the right place
rather than waiting to see where your desires take you in the moment.

- The shift to a delayed-return environment likely began around the advent o f
agriculture ten thousand years ago when farmers began planting crops in
anticipation of a harvest months later. However, it was not until recent centuries
that our lives became filled with delayed-return choices: career planning,
retirement planning, vacation planning, and everything else that occupies our
calendars.
- Time inconsistency is also referred to ashyperbolic discounting.

- This can derail our decision making as well. The brain overestimates the
danger of anything that seems like an immediate threat but has almost no
likelihood of actually occurring: your plane crashing during a bit of turbulence, a
burglar breaking in while you’re home alone, a terrorist blowing up the bus
you’re on. Meanwhile, it underestimates what appears to be a distant threat but is
actually very likely: the steady accumulation of fat from eating unhealthy food,
the gradual decay of your muscles from sitting at a desk, the slow creep o f
clutter when you fail to tidy up.
- Interested readers can find a habit tracker template at
atomichabits.com/tracker.

- You can see the actual Habit Contracts used by Bryan Harris and get a blan k
template at atomichabits.com/contract.
- If you are interested in taking a personality test, you can find links to the most
reliable tests here: atomichabits.com/personality.

- If it’s Harry Potter on repeat, I feel you.
- I have a pet theory about what happens when we achieve a flow state. This
isn’t confirmed. It’s just my guess. Psychologists commonly refer to the brain as
operating in two modes: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast and instinctual.
Generally speaking, processes you can perform very quickly (like habits) are
governed by System 1. Meanwhile, System 2 controls thinking processes that are
more effortful and slow—like calculating the answer to a difficult math problem.
With regard to flow, I like to imagine System 1 and System 2 as residing on
opposite ends of the spectrum of thinking. The more automatic a cognitive
process is, the more it slides toward the System 1 side of the spectrum. The more
effortful a task is, the more it slides toward System 2. Flow, I believe, resides on
the razor’s edge between System 1 and System 2. You are fully using all of your
automatic and implicit knowledge related to the task while also working hard to
rise to a challenge beyond your ability. Both brain modes are fully engaged. The
conscious and nonconscious are working perfectly in sync.

- The discovery of variable rewards happened by accident. One day in the lab,
the famous Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner was running low on food pellets
during one experiment and making more was a time-consuming process because
he had to manually press the pellets in a machine. This situation led him to “as k
myself why every press of the lever had to be reinforced.” He decided to only
give treats to the rats intermittently and, to his surprise, varying the delivery o f
food did not decrease behavior, but actually increased it.
- I created a template for readers interested in keeping a decision journal. It is
included as part of the habit journal at atomichabits.com/journal.

- You can see my previous Annual Reviews at jamesclear.com/annual-review.
- You can see my previous Integrity Reports at jamesclear.com/integrity.

- Sorites is derived from the Greek wordsorós, which meansheaporpile.
